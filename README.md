# âš¡ Battery Electrode Voltage Prediction using Machine Learning
This project marks my first major machine learning endeavor after three months of learning, marking the beginning of exploration into data-driven materials discovery. In this project, A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was developed and trained to predict the average voltage of battery electrode materials using computationally derived material descriptors. The objective is to facilitate the accelerated screening and identification of promising electrode candidates for advanced battery technologies.

## ðŸ“š Dataset Source
The dataset was sourced from the **[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)** â€” a leading open database of computed materials properties powered by high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
